## How to Use These Agents

### With Claude or Other AI Assistants

1. **Load the agent context:** Copy the entire content of the relevant agent file and include it in your prompt
2. **Ask your question:** Be specific about what you need help with
3. **Provide context:** Share relevant code snippets or error messages

Example:
```
[Paste contents of moonraker-api-agent.md]

I need to implement a new feature that monitors the printer's accelerometer
data in real-time and displays it as a graph. How should I structure the
WebSocket subscription and handle the high-frequency updates?
```

### As Reference Documentation

Each agent file serves as specialized documentation for its domain:
- Code patterns and examples
- Common issues and solutions
- Best practices and optimization tips
- Testing strategies

### For Code Reviews

Use agents to validate your implementation:
```
[Paste contents of general-coding-agent.md]

Review this panel implementation for thread safety and LVGL best practices:
[Your code here]
```

## Agent Maintenance

These agents should be updated when:
- Major architectural changes occur
- New patterns or conventions are adopted
- Common issues are discovered and solved
- Dependencies are updated (LVGL 8.3 ‚Üí 9.0)

## Project Context

- **Main Project:** Uses LVGL 8.3 with C++ panel classes
- **Prototype UI9:** Uses LVGL 9.3 with XML-based declarative UI system
- Use the **Widget Maker** agent specifically for prototype-ui9 work
- Use the **General Coding** agent for main project LVGL 8.3 work
