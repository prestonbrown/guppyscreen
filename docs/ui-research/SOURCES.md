## Next Steps

1. **Priority: Access PDF manuals** - Most likely to have clear UI screenshots
2. **Review comprehensive review sites** - 3DWithUs confirmed to have K1 screenshots
3. **Check YouTube videos** - May need to extract frames from video reviews
4. **Document each screenshot** - Create SOURCES.md files in each printer subdirectory

## Notes

- Official documentation typically has the cleanest, most representative UI screenshots
- Review sites often have real-world usage photos with actual screens
- Forum posts may have user-submitted photos but quality varies
- YouTube videos can be frame-grabbed but resolution may be lower
- Focus on Bambu X1C firmware 01.09+ as primary reference
