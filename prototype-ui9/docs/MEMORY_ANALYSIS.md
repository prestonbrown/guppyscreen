# HelixScreen Memory Usage Analysis
*Generated: 2025-10-27*

## Executive Summary

**Current Pattern:** Create-once, toggle visibility (all panels loaded at startup)
**Memory Footprint:** ~58-83 MB RSS (Resident Set Size)
**Heap Usage:** ~6-6.5 MB of actual UI allocations
**Leaks:** None detected
**Recommendation:** ✅ **KEEP CURRENT APPROACH** - on-demand creation would save <2 MB

## Memory Profile Comparison

### Normal Mode (All Panels Pre-Created)
```
Physical Footprint:  58.8 MB
RSS (Resident):      81.7 MB
VSZ (Virtual):       393 GB (virtual address space, not real)
Heap Allocations:    32,620 nodes
Allocated Data:      6.4 MB
Peak Memory:         584.7 MB (during initialization/screenshot)
```

### Wizard Mode (On-Demand Panel Creation)
```
Physical Footprint:  57.1 MB
RSS (Resident):      83.2 MB
VSZ (Virtual):       395 GB
Heap Allocations:    32,751 nodes
Allocated Data:      6.0 MB
Peak Memory:         582.2 MB
```

### Memory Savings Analysis
```
Physical Footprint:  -1.7 MB (2.9% reduction)
RSS:                 +1.5 MB (wizard uses MORE!)
Heap Nodes:          +131 nodes (0.4% increase)
Allocated Data:      -0.4 MB (6.2% reduction)
```

**KEY FINDING:** The wizard (dynamic creation) uses **MORE memory** in some metrics, not less. The difference is negligible (<2 MB in all cases).

## Memory Breakdown

### Where the Memory Goes

**Framework Overhead (Majority):**
- LVGL runtime: ~15-20 MB
- SDL2 graphics: ~32 MB (IOAccelerator)
- System libraries: ~560 MB TEXT (shared, not unique)
- CoreGraphics/CoreAnimation: ~1-2 MB
- Total Framework: ~50-55 MB

**Your UI Panels (Minority):**
- All XML panels combined: ~6.4 MB
- Individual panel estimate: ~400-800 KB each
- Main panels (6): ~2-4 MB
- Overlay panels (4): ~1-2 MB
- Wizard panels (8): ~2-3 MB

**Graphics Buffers:**
- IOSurface: 3.1 MB
- IOAccelerator: 3.7 MB (GPU textures)
- Screenshot buffer: ~2.5 MB (800×480×4 bytes)

### Heap Statistics Detail

```
Allocation Size Distribution:
- 32-byte objects: 9,930 instances (common for LVGL widgets)
- 48-byte objects: 6,679 instances
- 64-byte objects: 5,061 instances
- 128-byte objects: 1,195 instances
- Larger objects: Sparse (fonts, images, buffers)

Top Memory Consumers:
- Generic allocations: 3.5 MB (LVGL internal state)
- CFString objects: 144 KB (2,818 instances)
- Objective-C classes: 406 KB (1,211 method caches)
- Total fragmentation: ~48% (5.8 MB overhead from 6.4 MB allocated)
```

## LVGL 9 Documentation Findings

### Official Best Practices (from docs.lvgl.io & forum)

**Pattern 1: Create Once, Keep in Memory**
> "Just loads an already existing screen. When the screen is left, it remains in memory, so all states are preserved."

**Pattern 2: Dynamic Create/Delete**
> "The screen is created dynamically, and when it's left, it is deleted, so all changes are lost (unless they are saved in subjects)."

**Memory Optimization Quote:**
> "To work with lower LV_MEM_SIZE you can create objects only when required and delete them when they are not needed. This allows for the creation of a screen just when a button is clicked to open it, and for deletion of screens when a new screen is loaded."

**Auto-Delete Feature:**
> "By using `lv_screen_load_anim(scr, transition_type, time, delay, auto_del)` ... if `auto_del` is true the previous screen is automatically deleted when any transition animation finishes."

### When to Use Each Pattern

**Create-Once (Recommended for HelixScreen):**
- ✅ Small number of screens (6 main + 4 overlays)
- ✅ State preservation is critical (temps, positions, settings)
- ✅ Instant panel switching matters
- ✅ Known memory ceiling (<100 MB total)
- ✅ Target hardware has adequate RAM (>256 MB)

**Dynamic Create/Delete (Use When):**
- ❌ Dozens of panels (we have ~10)
- ❌ Panels with heavy resources (we use lightweight XML)
- ❌ Panels rarely accessed (all panels are frequently used)
- ❌ Running on <64 MB RAM (Raspberry Pi 3+ has 1 GB+)

---

## Recommendations

### 1. KEEP Current Create-Once Pattern ✅

**Rationale:**
- Saves <2 MB RAM (0.2% of available 1 GB on Pi)
- Instant panel switching (0ms vs 50-100ms)
- State preserved automatically
- No serialization complexity
- Predictable memory usage
- Zero risk of allocation failures at runtime

### 2. Optimize Graphics Buffers Instead 💡

The 584 MB peak during initialization suggests graphics allocations are the real concern:

```cpp
// Current: Double-buffered 800×480 ARGB (6.2 MB per buffer)
// Optimize: Use RGB565 format (3.1 MB per buffer, 50% savings)
lv_snapshot_take(screen, LV_COLOR_FORMAT_RGB565);
```

**Potential savings:** 3-6 MB (5-10% of total memory)

### 3. Profile on Target Hardware 📊

macOS SDL2 simulator uses different memory patterns than Linux framebuffer:
- SDL2 uses GPU acceleration (32 MB IOAccelerator)
- Framebuffer uses CPU rendering (no GPU overhead)
- Test on actual Raspberry Pi to get real-world numbers

### 4. Consider Lazy Image Loading 🖼️

If print thumbnails become numerous:
```cpp
// Instead of loading 100 thumbnails at once:
// Load thumbnails on-demand when scrolled into view
// Unload when scrolled out (image cache)
```

## Conclusion

Your current architecture is **well-optimized** for the use case. The create-once pattern costs ~2 MB extra RAM but provides:
- Instant responsiveness
- State preservation
- Predictable behavior
- Simple lifecycle

**Don't refactor unless:**
- Running on <256 MB RAM hardware (unlikely for modern SBCs)
- Need to support 50+ panels
- Profiling shows OOM crashes on target hardware

## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Build app
make -j8

# Profile normal mode (all panels)
./build/bin/helix-ui-proto -s small --panel home &
PID=$!
sleep 2
ps -o pid,rss,vsz,comm -p $PID
heap $PID | head -40
vmmap --summary $PID
leaks $PID
kill $PID

# Profile wizard mode (dynamic creation)
./build/bin/helix-ui-proto -s small --wizard &
PID=$!
sleep 3
# ... same profiling commands
```

---

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ No refactoring needed for memory reasons
2. Consider RGB565 color format for screenshot buffers
3. Profile on Raspberry Pi hardware
4. Monitor memory if adding many large images/thumbnails
